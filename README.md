# BMI Calculator

## Our Goal
The objective of this tutorial is to look at how we can customise Flutter Widgets to achieve our own beautiful user interface designs. If you have a designer on board, no matter how unconventional their designs are, we can create them using Flutter. 

## What you will create
Weâ€™re going to make a Body Mass Index Calculator inspired by the beautiful designs
